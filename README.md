# DevCase
#### Dev Case is a platform for developers to showcase their projects

## Why I created Dev Case
There are many developers who create great projects but there projects don't get much appreciation cause many people don't see there projects so to get that exposure i created __Dev Case__

- Go to __DevCase__ folder `cd DevCase`
- Run Server`python manage.py runserver`
- Open [Localhost](http://127.0.0.1:8000/home) in your browser.
